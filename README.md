# Electric Carbon

## 0xcarbon Blockchain based Desktop Trading App
0xcarbon Desktop Trading App based in Express, NodeJS, Typescript

Link for downloadable executable file for Win32 can be found below (stored on this repo). App will provide mnemonic login for the 0xcarbon (Token: SWTH) blockchain with a user interface for (starting with) ping pong enabled trading on the platform. Users may be aware of the chain via decentralized exchange (DEX), app.dem.exchange. Initially, enabled users will be heavily restricted. Only downloadable files will be provided (PLEASE -- ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB REPO). I will be seeking out others in the community to review the code for comment.

## Alpha Testing
The program should be considered in its infancy. While I have worked out many of the obstacles I had encountered adjusting to TS, there are many pieces that still need to be put together. Currently, the bot will only place orders via Ping Pong. It will not follow up on filled orders. Along with websocket restart and triangular arbitrage, it'll remain a top issue until resolution.

I had ceased development a couple of months ago in the belief I would not be returning to it. While I remain hesitant to commit too much time to the project, I figured it was worth a shot of seeing the amount of sentiment for such a thing.

## Login
A simple download will allow you access to the desktop app. You will NOT make it past the login section unless you contact me. Authentication will check your address against a database. If your "SWTH" or "TSWTH" address is not registered with the database, you will not be allowed access. This is because the app is being developed for a subscription based trading experience on 0xcarbon.
