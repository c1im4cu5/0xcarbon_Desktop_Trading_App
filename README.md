# 0xcarbon Desktop Trading App
0xcarbon Desktop Trading App based in Express,NodeJS,Typescript

Downloadable executable files will soon be provided for mnemonic login to DEX Demex on the 0xcarbon (Token: SWTH) blockchain with a user interface for (starting with) ping pong enabled trading on the platform. Initially, enabled users will be heavily restricted. Only downloadable files will be provided (PLEASE -- ONLY DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB REPO). I will be seeking out others in the community to review the code for comment.

## Login
A simple download will allow you access to the desktop app. You will NOT make it past the login section unless you contact me. Authentication will check your address against a database. If your "SWTH" or "TSWTH" address is not registered with the database, you will not be allowed access. This is because the app is being developed for a subscription based trading experience on 0xcarbon. It is in the initial stages, so beta users will not be charged.
